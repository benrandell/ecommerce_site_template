# ecommerce_site_template
This e-commerce template includes front-end and back-end functionality. It updates in real-time as the admin makes changes via a user-friendly GUI, directly syncing with the local database and updating front-end product display. On the consumer side, the template provides comprehensive functionality with a modern and engaging website design.

# Set Up
The website is set up to run from an Apache Server, with the provided files located in the 'htdocs' folder. The program utilizes PDO to establish a connection with the local database, facilitating updates to products and suppliers.

There are two main sections to this site: the admin side, accessible only with the correct username and password on the login page, and the consumer side, where you can browse and request products.

For updating your database, refer to the connection details in "connect.php". The database values and columns are provided as CSV files named "suppliers_table.csv" and "products_table.csv".
